# Pico-Remote-Analyzer
Firmware Version 1.00 released 18-JAN-2023

Did you ever want to add a remote control to one of your Raspberry Pi Pico projects ?

Have you ever lost one of your remote control unit and thought about replacing it with a "Pico-Remote-Translator",
translating another remote control that you have to emulate the one you lost instead of buying a new unit ?

Have you ever thought about adding "macro-commands" to one of your remote controls ?

If you answered "yes" to one or more of the questions above, this Firmware may help you reach your goal...

Basically, Pico-Remote-Analyzer will help you understand the underlying timings and allow you to decode one of your infrared remote controls,
so that you could recognize the commands sent by the unit and add functionalities to your project.
You may want to take a closer look at the Pico-Green-Clock (in my repository) if you want an example on how to add a remote control to a Pico project.
